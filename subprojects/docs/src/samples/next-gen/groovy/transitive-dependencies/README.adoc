This sample shows how transitive dependencies work with Java projects in Gradle.

The `application` project has an implementation dependency on the `utilities` project:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="application/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="application/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Which in turn has an API dependency on the `list` project:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="utilities/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="utilities/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

To build the projects, you simply needs to build the application:

====
[.testable-sample,dir="groovy"]
=====
[.sample-command]
